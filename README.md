## Features 🚀

### Backend ⚙️
- 🧠 **Personalized recommendation engine** built on a **Neo4j graph data model**, leveraging complex weighted Cypher queries (user similarity, ingredient and categories overlap, interaction weights).
- ⚡ **Redis‑backed performance layer for reducing database load and response latency**:
  - 🗄️ Caching of CPU‑intensive recommendation queries and frequently used data
  - 📈 Trending page implemented with **Redis ZSETs** (leaderboard pattern)
  - 🚦 Custom Redis‑backed **rate limiting** and **session storage**
- 🔁 **Unit of Work pattern** for sharing transactional context across multiple repositories within a single service operation, ensuring consistency for multi‑step domain operations such as recipe imports
- ⏱️ **Background import service** with cron scheduling that ingests and normalizes recipes from the **Spoonacular API** (ETL workflow).
- 🧱 **Production best practices**: layered architecture (routes → controllers → services → repositories), dependency injection, typed domain errors, global error handling, Zod validation, and full TypeScript coverage.

### Frontend 🎨 
- 🧰 **Modern React architecture** using **TanStack Query** and **TanStack Router** to enable advanced patterns like:
  - 🚀 Route‑level prefetching and fetch‑on‑navigation
  - 🗄️ Client‑side caching and deterministic cache invalidation
  - ⚡ Optimistic UI updates
- 📱 **Fully responsive and accessible UI** built with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn** components.
- ✨ **UX optimizations** such as skeleton loaders and smooth state transitions.

### Infrastructure & Deployment ☁️
- 📦 **Monorepo setup** with npm workspaces (`client`, `common`, `server`) and shared types/utilities.
- 🐳 **Backend containerized with Docker & Docker Compose**, running three services:
  - 🖥️ API server
  - ⏱️ Background import‑cron service
  - ⚡Redis
  - 🧭 Caddy reverse proxy
- 🌍 **Frontend** deployed to **Vercel** with CDN distribution and automatic deployments.
- 🏗️ **Backend** deployed on an **Oracle VPS**.
